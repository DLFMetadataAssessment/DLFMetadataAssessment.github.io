title: Schematron
abstract: Schematron is a schema language that can be used to define rules against which to validate an XML file. It can be used to express constraints on metadata beyond those included in schemas. For example, the MODS schema can say that title should be placed into the &lt;title&gt; element, but schematron can require that a title element appear in every record.
