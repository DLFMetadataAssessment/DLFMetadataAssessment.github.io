This is the website for the **[Digital Library Federation (DLF) Assessment Interest Group (AIG) Metadata Working Group](https://wiki.diglib.org/Assessment:Metadata)**, also known as the DLF Metadata Assessment Working Group.

The DLF Metadata Assessment Working Group aims to build guidelines, best practices, tools and workflows around the evaluation and assessment of (mostly, descriptive) metadata used by and for digital libraries and repositories. The foci of the work of the 2016 DLF Metadata Assessment Working Group are:

1. performing an environmental scan on the topic of metadata quality and assessment;
2. gathering use cases and definitions for metadata assessment needs and realities;
3. creating a preliminary framework and set of recommendations on metadata assessment.
