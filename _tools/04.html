title: Adobe Bridge
abstract: Adobe Bridge is a digital asset management application that supports embedded metadata in image files. Depending on the file format, the metadata is embedded within the file or saved in a sidecar file. Bridge utilizes Adobe's proprietary metadata standard Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) which is built on XML. XMP supports Exif, IPTC (IIM), GPS, TIFF, and other embedded metadata. Users can edit individual image files' embedded metadata via a form, a template, or XMP import. There is also an XMP export option. Further details can be found in Adobe's Adobe Photoshop User Guide in the “Metadata and notes” webpage (https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/metadata-notes.html).
