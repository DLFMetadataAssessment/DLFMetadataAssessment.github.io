title: LODrefine
abstract: While still operational, this tool is no longer supported/maintained. This is a LOD-enabled version of OpenRefine. It builds off OpenRefine version 2.5 with integrated extensions that make transition from tabular data to Linked Data more streamlined. It was built by a post-doc student at the now-defunct DERI institute, and makes heavy use of the DERI RDF extension. Last updated in 2013. Documentation URL not active.
