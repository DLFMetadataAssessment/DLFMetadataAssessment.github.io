First, it is adapted to the library context from the well-known and used Software Carpentry curriculum. Secondly, the tutorial interface has lots of exercises that can actually be done within the page and checked providing feedback as a tool for learning. In addition to concept-by-concept exercises, a basic example of applying the skill to a spreadsheet is included as well.
