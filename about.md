This is the website for the Digital Library Federation (DLF) Assessment Interest Group (AIG) Metadata Working Group, also known as the DLF Metadata Assessment Working Group.

The DLF Metadata Assessment Working Group aims to build guidelines, best practices, tools and workflows around the evaluation and assessment of (mostly, descriptive) metadata used by and for digital libraries and repositories. The group hopes to offer deliverables and recommendations that digital library and repository users can implement for metadata assessment and quality control.  The foci of the work of the 2016 DLF Metadata Assessment Working Group are performing a literature, tools, presentations and groups review/environmental scan on the topic of metadata quality and assessment, then creating a preliminary framework and set of recommendations for others looking to perform metadata assessment.

Anyone and everyone is welcomed to take part in the DLF AIG Metadata Working Group. Use the links below to find out more about the group or get involved.
