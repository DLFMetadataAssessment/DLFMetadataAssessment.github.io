description: "This tutorial describes what web scraping is and teaches two methods: using a scraping extension in the Chrome browser or a python library. Xpath is needed to use the extension, and while the tutorial covers it, a familiary with xml/xpath would be helpful. The python library Scrapy is covered for users who are already comfortable with Python. This is part of Library Carpentryâ€™s extended curriculum and is listed as an Alpha release, so it may change over time."
