<h2 id="survey">Survey of Benchmarks in Metadata Quality</h2>

**This survey was open May 23-July 10, 2019.**

As a part of the Digital Library Federation Forum, Assessment Interest Group, Metadata Working Group, the Metadata Quality Benchmarks subgroup created this survey to investigate metadata quality and how it is measured in libraries, archives, and museums. The goal of this survey was to gain insight into participants' methods and criteria for evaluating metadata quality and to identify potential gaps in present knowledge and practices.

This survey was open to anyone self-identifying as a metadata professional who is currently employed in a library, archive, museum or other cultural heritage institution. Specifically, eligible participants for this study were individuals with some responsibility for metadata management and/or creation for a digital repository.
