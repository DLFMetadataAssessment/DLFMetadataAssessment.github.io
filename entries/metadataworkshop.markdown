In 2017, the Metadata Working Group worked to expand on a metadata analysis workshop first given by DPLA at DPLA2017. This work was a collaborative effort with several of the original creators of the workshop.

The revised workshop was first offered at [DLFForum2017](https://forum2017.diglib.org/). It aimed to introduce library, archive, and museum metadata practitioners and technologists with the basic skills and knowledge needed to assess metadata quality using data analysis tools. The updated curriculum included an introduction to the [Metadata Assessment Framework](/Framework) developed by the Metadata Working Group and will close by helping participants strategize ways to bring these tools back into their daily workflows and continue to train others they work with to do the same. A Github repository with the material from the workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/DLFMetadataAssessment/DLFMetadataQAWorkshop17).

An updated version of the workshop was also presented at Learn @ DLF in 2018. The Github repository with the material from the workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/DLFMetadataAssessment/2018MetadataAnalysisWorkshop).
