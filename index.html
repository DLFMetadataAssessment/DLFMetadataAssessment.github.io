    <p>This is the working site of the Digital Library Federation's Assessment Interest Group (DLF AIG) Metadata Working Group. Find out more about the DLF AIG Metadata Working Group - or the Metadata Assessment Working Group - on the <a href="/about/">About page</a>.</p>

    <p>As the first phase of our work in 2016, we pulled together a literature, tools, presentations, and organization review on the topics of metadata quality and metadata assessment. You can see our Review - which we hope to keep as a living document - on the <a href="/review/">Review page</a>.</p>
