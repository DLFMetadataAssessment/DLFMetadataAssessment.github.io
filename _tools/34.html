title: pymarc
tool_title: Pymarc
abstract: Pymarc is a Python 3 library for working with bibliographic data encoded in MARC21. Starting with version 5.0.0 it requires Python 3.7 and up. It provides an API for reading, writing and modifying MARC records. It was mostly designed to be an emergency eject seat, for getting your data assets out of MARC and into some kind of saner representation. However, over the years it has been used to create and modify MARC records, since despite repeated calls for it to die as a format, MARC seems to be living quite happily as a zombie. Project documentation (https://pymarc.readthedocs.io/) and a pymarc GoogleGroup (https://groups.google.com/g/pymarc) are available.
