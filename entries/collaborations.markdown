The DLF AIG Metadata Working Group is welcome to collaborations with both other DLF Assessment Interest Group working groups and other organizations. 

### Past collaborative efforts
During early 2017, the goal was to gather information and collect ideas for collaboration. Volunteers served as "liaisons" for the following groups and kept up-to-date with both groups' activities and cotinues to bring up or document any possible areas for collaborative work as they appear.

### Resources from other DLF groups
The DLF Cultural Assessment Group created in 2017 an annotated bibliography for [Cultural Assessment of Digital Collections](https://osf.io/94pgj/), with one section of the bibliography dedicated to Metadata and Description Practices.
