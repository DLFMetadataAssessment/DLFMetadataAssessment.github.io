# The DLF AIG Metadata Working Group

The  Digital Library Federation (DLF) Assessment Interest Group (AIG) Metadata Working Group--also known as the Metadata Assessment Working Group (MAWG)--strives to collaboratively build guidelines, best practices, tools, and workflows around the evaluation and assessment of metadata used by and for digital libraries and repositories. We fulfill this mission by supporting discussions of metadata assessment and quality control, sharing metadata assessment approaches, and fostering a community of dedicated metadata assessment professionals.

# DLF Code of Conduct

The [Digital Library Federation (DLF)](https://www.diglib.org/) is committed to creating and supporting inclusive, diverse, and equitable communities of practice. We strive to be a [welcoming organization](https://www.diglib.org/members/join/) and the focal point for a digital library culture that is anti-oppression, anti-racist, recognizes intersectionalities, and works compassionately across difference. Together, DLF members [advance research, learning, social justice, and the public good through the creative design and wise application of digital library technologies](https://www.diglib.org/about/). We know that the best problem-solving and critical thinking happens when people with a wide array of experiences and perspectives come together to work in comfort and safety as peers. We therefore expect participants in the DLF community to help create thoughtful and respectful environments where that interaction can take place. This Code of Conduct applies to all meetings, events, working groups, and other activities organized through the DLF, including those taking place in-person or online.
