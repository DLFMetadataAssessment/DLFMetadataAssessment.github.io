title: Metadata Breakers
abstract: This Python script allows you to parse digital library metadata exposed in an OAI-PMH repository. The data comes in as OAI, and Metadata Breakers provides flexible options for outputting the data in a format that other tools can easily use it. More detailed explanation and examples of how the tool could be used are found in a 2013 Code4Lib article http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/7818
