title: DPLA Aggregation Tools
tool_title: DPLA Aggregation Tools
abstract: This set of tools provides a way of visually browsing metadata from OAI-PMH feeds, with the option to check for values in required fields. Data is displayed in grids, allowing a user to more effectively assess an entire set/collection. Can be particularly useful for people who would like to assess the metadata available over OAI-PMH but who are not comfortable reviewing XML. While the tools are set to review simple dublin core and a set of required fields that applies to NCDHC, this can be modified by changing the code to review a qualified dublin core OAI-PMH feed, and the setting for required fields can also be adjusted. At the University of Utah, we are using these tools (modified by the Mountain West Digital Library) to assess mappings and required field values for legacy collections.
