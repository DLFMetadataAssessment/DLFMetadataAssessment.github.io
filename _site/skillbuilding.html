<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This list of tutorials and resources is offered to support those who are interested in contributing and collaborating on the site maintenance and improvement. One of the 2018 goals of the Website Subgroup is to maintain a document to encourage self-guided learning for Jekyll, Git, and GitHub.</p>

<p>Each resource includes a description of its usefulness, applicability to the group’s work on this site, or general ease of use. Recommendations and tips are included, as well.</p>

<h2 id="general-intro">General Introduction to Website and its Structure</h2>

<p>This site presents a comprehensive but simplified resource for how to approach metadata assessment. In 2019, the MWG Website subgroup updated the site to run on a simplified Jekyll template, resulting in a more streamlined and unified structure. The intention was to increase usability of the site and its contents.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-git-what-is-github">What is Git? What is GitHub?</h3>

<p>A very common question! The quote below from <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCodeYearIG/Codeyear-IG-Github-Project/blob/master/Getting%20Started/readme.mdown#what-is-git-what-is-github">Library Code Year’s GitHub Tutorial</a> explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Git is an open source version control software. Think of it as a way to manage multiple people working on the same project; Git allows them to smartly “merge” changes to avoid conflicts. It also keeps a history of the project, so that you can roll back to a time before an error was introduced.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>GitHub is a cloud-based storage site for git. It is a central place where everyone can download projects, track ongoing issues, and view information. It’s not the only such site—Gitorious is another one, for example—but it’s very popular and has some nice features.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-is-jekyll">What is Jekyll?</h3>

<p>Jekyll is a static site generator. It builds a static website for you based on simple text files organized into folders and their corresponding HTML templates. GitHub pages are powered by Jekyll. For more information see: https://jekyllrb.com/</p>

<p><em>Excerpt from CloudCannon’s <a href="https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/why-use-a-static-site-generator/">‘Why use a static site generator?’</a>:</em> […] the difference between dynamic CMSs such as WordPress or Drupal and static site generators like Jekyll:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Static sites respond quickly because it retrieves files only, so there is not a lot of processing</li>
  <li>Static sites are more secure; not as many vulnerabilities; no plugins</li>
  <li>Static sites on server can handle more traffic</li>
  <li>Static sites have version control</li>
</ul>
