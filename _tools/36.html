title: Sinopia
tool_title: Sinopia
abstract: "Sinopia is a linked data creation environment where libraries can: create metadata in a linked data environment without having to set up and maintain tools; learn best practices related to linked data creation; explore the idea of cooperative cataloging (linking to shared descriptions and identifiers) in a linked data environment; contribute feedback and expertise to iterative development of tools for working in a linked data environment. There are two environments: stage and production. Beginners are recommended to use the Stage environment for experimentation."
