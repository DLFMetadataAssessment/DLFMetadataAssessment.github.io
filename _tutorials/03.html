description: Catmandu is a data processing toolkit developed as part of the LibreCat project. Catmandu provides a command line tool and a suite of Perl modules to ease the import, storage, retrieval, export and transformation  of library related data sets. This 18-part tutorial uses Catmandu to analyze data in various formats (MARC, JSON, CSV). Initial lessons are to set up a virtual box and use UNIX, but some familiarity would likely make this easier. Each lesson is a separate blog post, and some have robust comments and implementation notes.
