Technology
-------------

This website uses Jekyll, a static site generator, and is published using GitHub Pages.

### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator with built-in support for GitHub Pages. It builds a static website for you based on simple text files organized into folders and their corresponding HTML templates. For more information see: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

_Excerpt from CloudCannon’s [‘Why use a static site generator?’](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/why-use-a-static-site-generator/):_ \[…\] the difference between dynamic CMSs such as WordPress or Drupal and static site generators like Jekyll:

*   Static sites respond quickly because it retrieves files only, so there is not a lot of processing
*   Static sites are more secure; not as many vulnerabilities; no plugins
*   Static sites on server can handle more traffic
*   Static sites have version control

### What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. For more information see: [What is GitHub Pages?](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages)
