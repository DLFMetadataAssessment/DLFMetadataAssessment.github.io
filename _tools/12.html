title: Open Refine
tool_title: Open Refine
abstract: OpenRefine is a free, open source data normalization and reconciliation tool that runs locally in a web browser. Can work with large sets of data, but does best processing <100k lines at a time. Users can utilize faceted search and browsing to identify similar data, or rely on the built-in, super-charged algorithms that suggest ‘clusters’ of data that OpenRefine thinks can be normalized to a single value (including suggesting the ‘best’ value based on relevancies defined in the algorithm). Very useful for assessing and migrating legacy metadata from different systems, and plays well with lots of standard data storage formats (CSV and other *-delimited files, RDF, XML, JSON, etc). Advanced users can explore OpenRefine as a tool for linking existing data to external sources (eg FreeBase) or normalizing data using programming languages for complex queries. Relatively short learning curve for ‘basic’ level of usage - common actions have built in buttons, pretty intuitive navigation and design, and import/export is very simple. openrefine.org provides easy-to-understand video tutorials, in addition to text-based documentation
