### Instructions

This form will allow you to submit your institution's application profiles, mappings, crosswalks and metadata code as digital files to the Clearinghouse project[1]. The MAP Clearinghouse is a project of the Digital Library Federation (DLF) Assessment Interest Group (AIG) Metadata Assessment Working Group[2]. The Metadata Assessment Working Group aims to build guidelines, best practices, tools and workflows around the evaluation and assessment of (mostly, descriptive) metadata used by and for digital libraries and repositories.
