Metadata application profile for Rice University Electronic Thesis and Dissertations
 
This document presents existing metadata elements used for the description and long-term stewardship of Rice’s electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). This profile is based on recommendations from the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations' (NDLTD) metadata standards for ETDs and the Texas Digital Library's (TDL) ETD MODS application profile as used in the Vireo: ETD Submission and Management system. Elements primarily reflect new practices with the implementation of the Vireo system, but also explain legacy practices with data prior to new ETD system. Elements are comprised of qualified Dublin Core-based descriptive metadata set.
