# DLF AIG Metadata Working Group Site Outline

This is the proposed reorganization of the DLF AIG Metadata Working Group output. This outline is to ensure we cover all work that is currently being done, as well as to help us plan our Jekyll changes/migration.

The .md / .html extensions to propose pages have been removed, as they will be dependent on the Jekyll migration regardless. Instead, the bolded portions are just indicated to be pages, further form (stand-alone html, post, include, other) to be determined.

## **index**: Introduction, Scoping, Overview (2016-2017): Homepage

Information on **index**, which is ultimately the homepage:

* DLF AIG Parent Organization
* Quality versus Assessment
* Procedure for public feedback + updates
* Areas of past, current & proposed work

## **Why**: Importance of Metadata Assessment (2017): Homepage

Information on **Why**, and this may get integrated with **index**:

* Proposed collaboration project with Analytics group
* Have filler section for now with proposed work mentioned

## **Glossary**: Glossary & References (2016-7): [Homepage, link to cleaned up Google doc for now]()

* Glossary of terms used on the site.
* Seems appropriate to exist outside of the Framework page(s).

## **Collaborations**: Collaborations with Other Groups (2017): Homepage

* List of collaborations with other groups as projects emerge.
* Way for groups to get involved if interested.
* depending on 2018 work, this may move to its own repo.

## **Contact & Get Involved**: Homepage

* Take and expand what exists already.
* Might also be the right place to embed the update form.

## **Full Group Contributors**: Homepage

* List of participants and contributors broken out by year.

## **Sidebar** with site structure: Homepage but needs cleanup

* This will have to be regenerated elsewhere.
* This is an includes bit, not a page...?
* Is generated now based on Jekyll theme use of posts naming/metadata.

## **Scan**: Environmental scan (2016): [Child Repo](https://github.com/DLFMetadataAssessment/EnvironmentalScan)

Information on **Scan**, which is largely the site information as it exists now in production:

* Procedure for updates
* Update form
* Zotero Usage
* Preliminary Material / Introduction to the Environmental Scan
* Environmental Scan parts (as posts? child pages?)
* Way to download scan

## **Framework**: [Child Repo]()

This will shift as the Framework work continues and outputs shift.

For now, the top level page will have preliminary/introductory materials on the the purposes of the Framework, approaches to use, etc.

## **Tools**: Expanded tools recommendations (2016-?): [Child Repo]()

* Take work that fed into Environmental Scan and expand
* Site page will embed or link to Clearinghouse search interface

## **Profiles**: Metadata Profiles and Mappings Clearinghouse (2017): [Child Repo]()

* Site page will embed or link to Clearinghouse search interface, links to the work, repo, or just description of the output as decided.
