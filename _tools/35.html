title: QA catalogue
tool_title: QA catalogue
abstract: "QA catalogue is a set of metadata quality assessment tools for MARC records. It consists of three parts: First, a core programming library providing a Java API and a command line interface. Second, a web based UI displaying the results of the quality assessment and also providing a specific discovery interface for those who work with MARC data (cataloguers, metadata experts, software developers). Third, a web service to analyse a small number of records. The latter provides a REST API that could be used in a cataloguing workflow."
