The DLF AIG Metadata Working Group is open to anyone interested in collaborating on guidelines, best practices, tools, and workflows for the assessment of metadata used by and for digital libraries and repositories. See the [projects]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}) page for examples of current projects to join, such as updating this website or reviewing notable presentations and publications.

The group holds working meetings from January through the DLF Forum in November. An updated list of meeting dates and times for the current year is on the group [wiki page](https://wiki.diglib.org/Assessment:Metadata) and is also maintained on the [DLF Community Calendar](https://www.diglib.org/opportunities/calendar/). Subgroups may hold additional meetings as needed.

To join the group, visit our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dlf-aig-metadata-assessment-working-group). Group membership provides access to all shared documents, meeting connection information, and MWG announcements.
