The DLF AIG Metadata Working Group is open to anyone interested in collaborating on guidelines, best practices, tools, and workflows for the assessment of metadata used by and for digital libraries and repositories. See the [projects]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}) page for examples of current projects to join, such as updating this website or reviewing notable presentations and publications.
