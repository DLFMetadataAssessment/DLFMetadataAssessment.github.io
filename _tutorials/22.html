description: This resource is not a tutorial, but a free, online version of an R textbook. The reviewers did not work through the entire text, but this is a very thorough resource and has exercises throughout. As this is an advanced study of R, at least basic knowledge is a requirement. It does not walk the user through practical issues like setting up an editor or running code.
