<h3>Summary</h3>

The DLF Metadata Assessment group surveyed and analyzed:

- - -- general data tools,
- - -- cultural heritage institution metadata-specific tools,
- - -- programming languages/libraries that support metadata-specific activities, and
- - -- datasets and dataset aggregators.

The 2016 environmental scan captures information about the use, status, and application of 20 tools.


<h4>How to Read Our Tools Document</h4>

The [Tools Documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PCi_3pcWSFQ9fR54AxwO7LWuBUu2vbVw1etvw_UAl5g/edit?usp=sharing) is intended to aid the evaluation of tools for potential use in metadata assessment. 

The documentation presents general information about each tool, such as its purpose and type along with a descriptive summary and URL. The documentation also provides details that may influence adoption, such as technical requirements, support, and budgetary considerations. Links to source code and documentation are included for further research.
