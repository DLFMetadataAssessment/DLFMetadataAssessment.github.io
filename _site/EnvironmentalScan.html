<h2 id="orgs">Organizations &amp; Groups</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>As of 2016, a wide range of groups are addressing issues related to metadata and issues related to assessment of library services, but relatively few are directly working on the assessment of metadata. Here are some organizations and resources of interest collected.</p>

<h3>Europeana</h3>

<p><a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/">Europeana</a> is actively working to develop quality standards for metadata. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160901075956/https://pro.europeana.eu/page/data-quality-committee">Data Quality Committee</a> is addressing many issues related to metadata, including required elements for ingest of Europeana Data Model (EDM) data and meaningful metadata values in the context of use. “This work includes measures for information value of statements (informativeness, degree of multilinguality…) “ (p. 3). Of particular note is the committee’s statement on data quality: “The Committee considers that data quality is always relative to intended use and cannot be analysed or defined in isolation from it, as a theoretical effort” (p. 1).</p>

<p><a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Metadata%20Quality%20Report.pdf">Europeana’s Report and Recommendations from the Task Force on Metadata Quality</a> is an essential read, outlining broad issues related to metadata quality as well as specific recommendations for the Europeana community. This report defines good metadata quality as “1. Resulting from a series of trusted processes 2. Findable 3. Readable 4. Standardised 5. Meaningful to audiences 6. Clear on re-use 7. Visible” (p. 3). In addition, the report explores hindrances to good metadata quality: lack of foresight for online discovery, treating metadata as an afterthought, lack of funding and resources, describing digitized items with little information, and not understanding the harvesting requirements.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_taskforces/Enrichment_Evaluation/FinalReport_EnrichmentEvaluation_102015.pdf">Task Force on Enrichment and Evaluation’s Final Report</a> provides ten recommendations for successful enrichment strategies. See Valentine Charles and Juliane Stiller’s presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U90Ajgjk6ic">Evaluation of Metadata Enrichment Practices in Digital Libraries</a> provides additional background information for this report.</p>

<h3>Hydra Groups</h3>

<p><em>Update: In 2017 the Hydra Project’s name was changed to <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera">Samvera</a>.</em> The <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Metadata+Interest+Group">Hydra Metadata Interest Group</a> has multiple subgroups that have developed best practices for <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Technical+Metadata+Application+Profile">technical metadata</a>, <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Rights+Metadata+Recommendation">rights metadata</a>, <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Segment+of+a+File+Structural+Metadata+Working+Group">Segment of a File structural metadata</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Applied+Linked+Data+Interest+Group">Applied Linked Data</a>. The best practices and metadata application profiles developed by these groups can help in the assessment of metadata quality, but the work of these groups has not yet explicitly included metadata assessment.  The <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Metrics+Interest+Group">Hydra Metrics Interest Group</a> is involved in the use of scholarly and web metrics to assess the performance of various aspects of Hydra instances.</p>

<h3>Society of American Archivists (SAA)</h3>

<p>Although very little directly related to metadata assessment is available from the SAA, the 2010 presentation by Joyce Celeste Chapman, <a href="http://www2.archivists.org/sites/all/files/saa_description_presentation_2010_chapman.pdf">“User Feedback and Cost/Value Analysis of Metadata Creation”</a> contains many findings that merit consideration. This project studied the information seeking behavior of researchers and regarded successful searches as indicative of the value of metadata. The fields used most often by researchers were identified and the time needed to create metadata for those fields was analyzed in order to determine if the time spent creating metadata was related to the frequency of researcher use.</p>

<h3>ALA ALCTS “Big Heads”</h3>
<p><em>(i.e. “ALA ALCTS Technical Services Directors of Large Research Libraries IG (Big Heads)”)</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804063754/http://connect.ala.org/files/7981/costvaluetaskforcereport2010_06_18_pdf_77542.pdf">Final Report of the Task Force on Cost/Value Assessment of Bibliographic Control</a> defines the value of metadata as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Discovery success</li>
  <li>Use</li>
  <li>Display understanding</li>
  <li>Ability of our data to operate on the open web and interoperate with vendors/ suppliers in the bibliographic supply chain</li>
  <li>Ability to support the FRBR user tasks</li>
  <li>Throughput/Timeliness</li>
  <li>Ability to support the library’s administrative/management goals</li>
</ol>

<p>The use of “ability to support the FRBR user tasks” as a criterion for assessment of metadata quality was cited in Chapman’s (2010) presentation as an indicator of metadata quality.</p>

<p>The report found that describing the cost of metadata is extremely difficult, especially when considering the various operations that support and enable the creation of metadata. The authors acknowledge that the nebulous definitions of value outlined in the report also create challenges for defining what is meant by “cost” in this context.</p>

<h3>USETDA</h3>
<p><em>(i.e. “US Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Association”)</em></p>

<p>The 2015 presentation <a href="http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc725793/">“Understanding User Discovery of ETD: Metadata or Full-Text, How Did They Get There?”</a> describes the use of web traffic for metadata analysis. The percentage of successful searches that included terms from an item’s descriptive metadata vs. the percentage of successful searches that included terms from the full text of an item was analyzed to determine how often descriptive metadata contributed to the discovery of an item.</p>

<h3>ALCTS/LITA Metadata Standards</h3>

<p>This joint committee has recently drafted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303095702/http://metaware.buzz/2015/10/27/draft-principles-for-evaluating-metadata-standards/">“Principles for Evaluating Metadata Standards”</a>, which provides seven principles intended to apply to the “development, maintenance, governance, selection, use, and assessment of metadata standards” by LAM organizations. The principles recommend metadata standards that meet real-world needs, are open, flexible, and actively maintained, and that support network connections and interoperability. A recent committee blog post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160918105442/http://metaware.buzz/2016/04/18/summary-of-comments-received-on-msc-principles-for-evaluating-metadata-standards/">summarizes and responds to public comments</a> made on the initial draft, with a subsequent draft expected later this spring. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180915041307/http://metaware.buzz/2016/08/04/principles-for-evaluating-metadata-standards/">final draft of the “Principles for Evaluating Metadata Standards,”</a> which was not evaluated as part of the 2016 Environmental Scan, was added to this page in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="pubs">Publications</h2>

<p>The publications review described in this section was initially completed in 2016 and updated in 2019. We continue to actively collect citations of interest in the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/metadata_assessment">Metadata Assessment Zotero Group</a> and welcome any additions or updates you would like to offer to that list.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The group initially surveyed more than 50 documents in 2016 produced as early as 2002, ranging from journal articles, white papers, and reports to blog posts and wikis. In 2019, the group reviewed more than 100 articles added to the Metadata Assessment Zotero Group since 2016 to determine if changes or additions should be made to this list of publications of note.</p>

<p>Metadata assessment involves articulating conceptual criteria and frameworks as well as developing actionable methods to collect specific information about collections. The documents we surveyed tend to focus on the following themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Development of conceptual frameworks/models/metrics for defining metadata quality</li>
  <li>Enrichment of existing datasets to meet quality metrics</li>
  <li>Changes to metadata over time</li>
  <li>Measurement of auditing quality</li>
  <li>Considerations for shared metadata</li>
</ul>

<p>Exploring what metadata quality means in large-scale aggregators, such as Europeana and DPLA, is another topic discussed in recent work.</p>

<p>Bruce and Hillmann’s 2004 article, “The Continuum of Metadata Quality,” which defines a framework with seven categories of metadata quality (completeness, accuracy, conformance to expectations, logical consistency, accessibility, timeliness, provenance), is particularly noteworthy for influencing the subject’s subsequent exploration.</p>

<p>In 2013, Hillmann and Bruce revisited their original framework in the context of the linked open data environment, highlighting additional considerations such as licensing, correct/consistent data modeling, and the implications of linked data technology on definitions of metadata quality.</p>

<p>A common theme across the publications we reviewed is the subjective nature of “quality,” since its definition is dependent upon local context and content as well as institutional goals. According to Hillmann and Bruce (2013), conceptual criteria are “the lenses that help us know quality when we see it.” Through building a community of practice for assessing metadata quality, we will be better positioned to have a shared vision, one that provides for the sustainability of our resources and meets the needs of our users and systems.</p>

<h3>Publications of Note</h3>

<p>Citations gathered by the publications review group are available in a Zotero group library <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/metadata_assessment">(https://www.zotero.org/groups/metadata_assessment)</a>, which serves as a collaborative shared repository of all the resources explored as part of this process.</p>

<p>We have identified a subselection of these articles, listed below, which we recommend as good starting points for librarians interested in learning about metadata assessment. The articles review foundational concepts, present sound frameworks for analysis, cover particular common aspects of assessment, and/or have been influential in other research.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>In 2016, DLF Metadata Assessment Working Group surveyed and analyzed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>general data tools,</li>
  <li>cultural heritage institution metadata-specific tools,</li>
  <li>programming languages/libraries that support metadata-specific activities, and</li>
  <li>datasets and dataset aggregators.</li>
</ul>

<p>This environmental scan captured information about the use, status, and application of 20 tools. In 2017, the initial list of tools gathered as part of the environmental scan was reviewed with an eye to developing resources for tool testing.</p>

<p>Testing metadata assessment tools is slated to begin late 2017. Subsequent steps include the development of a repository for metadata assessment tools. The repository would include information gathered from the environmental scan as well as data and resources related to the evaluation of metadata asssessment tools.</p>

<h4>How to Read Our Tools Document</h4>
